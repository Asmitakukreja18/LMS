How I Built This Project

This e-learning website was completely developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript — no backend frameworks, no fancy CMS. Just pure front-end work.

I started by designing the main structure in HTML, making sure each page (Home, About, Contact, Shop, Cart, Checkout, Login, Registration, etc.) had a clean layout and semantic flow. Then I styled everything using Bootstrap 5 for responsiveness and added custom CSS to give it a polished.

JavaScript powers all the interactivity — like adding/removing courses from the cart, dynamic pricing updates, and localStorage for saving cart data even after refreshing.

The whole platform is designed to be fully responsive, lightweight, and easy to maintain, giving users a seamless learning experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
